## About Me

I'm a Computer Science and ML student at Carnegie Mellon University focused on building intelligent systems that operate under real world constraints, whether that is high performance memory allocators, multimodal AI pipelines, robotics control systems, or document intelligence platforms.

My work spans:

* Machine Learning and Vision Research: cortical magnification, foveated blur pipelines, gaze prediction
* LLM Engineering and Retrieval Systems: production RAG pipelines with reranking and retrieval verification
* Systems Programming: memory allocators, HTTP proxies, cache simulators, Unix shells
* Robotics and Control Systems: odometry based nonlinear course correction and autonomous vision
* Human Centered AI Tools: clean interfaces for high cognitive load workflows

I care deeply about understanding tradeoffs between abstraction and performance, model size and inference speed, usability and flexibility.

## Projects

### Vocal Vitals

AI driven vocal health analytics platform. Built using RMS energy tracking, VAD, MFCC based spectral features, and deep learning strain classification to detect breath instability and vocal breakdown during performance.
GitHub: [https://github.com/ronavjaiswal](https://github.com/ronavjaiswal)

### GMP RAG Document Intelligence

Built during my SWE and AI ML internship at Herbochem Industries. Production RAG system using FastAPI, Streamlit, ChromaDB, e5 embeddings with contrastive fine tuning, MMR diversification, and cross encoder reranking. Reduced compliance search time by 50 percent.
