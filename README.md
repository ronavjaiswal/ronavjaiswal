## About Me

I'm a Computer Science and ML student at Carnegie Mellon University focused on building intelligent systems that operate under real world constraints, whether that is high performance memory allocators, multimodal AI pipelines, robotics control systems, or document intelligence platforms.

I have done the below cool stuff -

* Machine Learning and Vision Research: cortical magnification, foveated blur pipelines, gaze prediction
* LLM Engineering and Retrieval Systems: production RAG pipelines with reranking and retrieval verification
* Systems Programming: memory allocators, HTTP proxies, cache simulators, Unix shells
* Robotics and Control Systems: odometry based nonlinear course correction and autonomous vision
* Human Centered AI Tools: clean interfaces for high cognitive load workflows

I care deeply about understanding tradeoffs between abstraction and performance, model size and inference speed, usability and flexibility.

## Projects

**Vocal Vitals** – AI driven vocal health analytics platform. Built using RMS energy tracking, VAD, MFCC based spectral features, and deep learning strain classification to detect breath instability and vocal breakdown during performance. GitHub: [https://github.com/ronavjaiswal/AI-Vital-Vocals-TartanHacks26](https://github.com/ronavjaiswal/AI-Vital-Vocals-TartanHacks26)

**GMP RAG Document Intelligence** – Built during my SWE and AI ML internship at Herbochem Industries. Production RAG system using FastAPI, Streamlit, ChromaDB, e5 embeddings with contrastive fine tuning, MMR diversification, and cross encoder reranking. Reduced compliance search time by 50 percent.

**Log Z Foveated Vision Pipeline - Undergraduate Research Fellow under Prof. Tai Sing Lee** – Researching log-Z cortical magnification and foveated blur pipelines in OpenCV, simulating retinal transformations for gaze prediction. Training and benchmarking deep learning and saliency models (PyTorch, DeepGaze IIe) on the eye-tracking datasets, improving gaze prediction accuracy and robustness by log-Z foveation simulations.

**Custom Malloc** – Dynamic memory allocator in C implementing malloc, free, realloc, and calloc using segregated free lists and coalescing. Optimized for high utilization and throughput.

**Tiny Unix Shell** – Unix style shell supporting job control, signal handling, foreground and background execution, and I O redirection. Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qYib1B6fa8XySehJ9ttSrCtFatpenHAZ?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qYib1B6fa8XySehJ9ttSrCtFatpenHAZ?usp=sharing)

**HTTP Proxy Server** – Multithreaded HTTP proxy in C using POSIX threads and Robust I O for concurrent request handling. Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KQI5O9x3balqcKt_nzXdwgZmXqeCSc5N?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KQI5O9x3balqcKt_nzXdwgZmXqeCSc5N?usp=drive_link)

**Cache Simulator** – Configurable cache simulator supporting arbitrary size and associativity, LRU replacement, write back and write allocate policies with matrix transpose optimization. Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m13yI8u1698-V47Mv0ptVm6IWyt_gypO?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m13yI8u1698-V47Mv0ptVm6IWyt_gypO?usp=sharing)

**Game Discover Hub** – Scalable React and TypeScript web application integrating the RAWG API with a clean and responsive UI. GitHub: [https://github.com/ronavjaiswal/GamerVerse-Hub](https://github.com/ronavjaiswal/GamerVerse-Hub)
